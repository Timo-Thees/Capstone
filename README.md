# Write Now!

Write Now! is a training app for writers and aspiring writers, professionals and hobbyists. 

To pursuing writing, eather as a carer or as a hobby, one has to master two steps:
1: You have to start writing
2: You have to keep writing
Write Now! is intendet to help with that part. On the Goals page the user can set up a wordcount they want to hit every session, as well as specify the dates and times they want to write. 

Once you write the app will check your goals against our made progress and celebrate your achievments with you. Under the progress tap you can see how much you already achieved in past sessions and if you keep hitting your goal.
